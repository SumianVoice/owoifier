Wait so they went anyway? I thought the weather was going to be bad so I cancelled it all on my end. How are they even going to get there aren't the bridges closed?

Well yes, but also no. I haven't been there so I don't know if they still sell it. All I know is they don't ship internationally unless you pay like, 100 bucks.

What the hell was that!? They just spawnsniped the whole damn team like 5 times in a row all with headshots. This has gotta be hacks.

So I haven't introduced you two yet have I. I'll have to invite you both on the weekend, you've got tons in common, I reckon you'll get on great.

Did you ever get that flashlight I told you about? Mine's so powerful I used it to cook a bit of beef haha. It's so bright, I think like 4000 lumens or something crazy like that. Gotta make sure you get the right batteries though otherwise they'll burn it out.

I couldn't sleep last night... I ended up getting up and having a cup of tea. I don't know why, I don't usually have trouble sleeping but for some reason my eyes were just wired open. You ever get that?

Oh my god the dinner last night was so amazing! You had the tacos too right? That sauce on it was incredible I just want like 100 liters of the stuff so I can put it on everything. </textarea> <br>
